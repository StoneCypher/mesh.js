Isomorphic example of using models & collections with mesh

Inspiration:
- http://deepstream.io/

Features:

- models are entirely isomorphic. Use different data stores such as `mongodb`,


Todo:

- demonstrate intermediate caching with local storage & HTTP
- expose models as restful interface - map relationships to API
- use models on backend with mongodb
- demonstrate realtime data
