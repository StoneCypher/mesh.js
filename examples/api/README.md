API example demonstrating how you can easily map endpoints to `CRUD` methods. Note that
the API used here is intentionally mangled to give an idea on how to normalize APIs that are a bit
wonky.

#### Features

- caches `GET` responses for a period of time
- realtime data using socket.io
- fault tolerant - requests will be re-executed if they fail
- ability to load fixtures (fake data)
