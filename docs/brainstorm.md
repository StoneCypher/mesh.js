Questions:

- What?
  - reactive streaming data store library
  - more-so a fancy-ass event-bus system
    - but it's streamable
  - use as a database abstraction layer
  - use as a realtime system
  - abstracts your service layer
- Why?
  - abstract service layer so that app is not coupled
  - more flexibil
  - enable applications to be run on dif
- use-cases
  - offline-mode.
  - initial data rendered by the server.
  - isomorphic front-ends. Faster initial load times.
  - realtime data
  - event bus system
  - rollback data
- What can it do?
